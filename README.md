# encoding-compression-investigation
This project aims to evaluate different combinations of readily available encryption and compression algorithms in Python with respect to autonomous vehicle network transmission

Dependencies:
* pynacl
* pycryptodome
* fernet
* numpy
* glob
* pandas

TODOs:
* investigate timings
* continue work on ppt (graphs, written sections)
* add data folder for visual simplicity in directory
* allow for blank args in results_processor.get_data()
* continue related work investigation
* consider adding console status updates
* work on readme
* find file size where preferred order switches - between 10 and 95MB - binary search
* implement asymmetric key encryption
* implement lossy compression algorithm
* broad narrative
* more test file types and sizes
* consider Python Style Guide
* documentation
