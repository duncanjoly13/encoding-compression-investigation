# encoding-compression-investigation
This project aims to evaluate different combinations of readily available encryption and compression algorithms in Python with respect to autonomous vehicle network transmission

Dependencies:
* pynacl
* pycryptodome
* fernet
* numpy

TODOs:
* allow for blank args in results_processor.get_data()
* continue related work investigation
* box plot of counts from characterization.py
* consider adding console status updates
* work on readme
* find file size where preferred order switches - between 10 and 95MB - binary search
* implement asymmetric key encryption
* implement lossy compression algorithm
* graphs
* broad narrative
* more test file types and sizes
* consider Python Style Guide
* documentation
